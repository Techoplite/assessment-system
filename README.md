 ## What is meant by assessment.
 An 'assessment' is made up of one or more 'problems'. Each problem can have an optional description, and must contain a question. Also, a problem must have at least two available answers, and one of them selected as the correct one.
 
 ## Known issues.
 At the moment it is possible to create a question with only one available answer. Also, when adding a problem to an assessment from the 'Edit Assessment' view, it is possible to create a problem without answers available. This issue has been partially fixed by informing the user with a message and a link reminding that answers should be created for the given problem.
 This problem is the next to be addressed in the schedule.
